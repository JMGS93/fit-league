    "nutritionalEducationContent": "At Fit League, we believe that a balanced diet is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and optimizing your physical performance. Below is a detailed guide to help you plan your meals in a balanced and delicious way.\n\n1. The Ideal Plate\nThe ideal plate should include foods from the three main groups:\n- Proteins: Essential for muscle repair and growth. Examples: chicken breast, fish, turkey, tofu, legumes.\n- Complex Carbohydrates: Provide sustained energy. Examples: brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta, potatoes.\n- Vegetables and Fruits: Supply vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Examples: broccoli, spinach, carrots, apples, berries.\n\n2. Meal Organization\n- Main Dish: Include a portion of lean protein (approximately the size of your palm) and a serving of complex carbohydrates (around 1 cup cooked).\n- Side Dishes: Complement your main dish with a generous portion of vegetables, preferably of different colors, to ensure a wide range of nutrients. You can opt for fresh salads or steamed vegetables.\n- Healthy Fats: Add a small portion of healthy fats, such as avocado, nuts, or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, to aid in vitamin absorption and provide additional energy.\n\n3. Practical Meal Combination Examples\n- Example 1: Grilled chicken breast with quinoa, steamed broccoli, and a tomato-spinach salad.\n- Example 2: Baked salmon fillet accompanied by brown rice, asparagus, and avocado slices.\n- Example 3: Stir-fried tofu with a mix of bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli, served with whole-grain rice noodles.\n- Example 4: Lentil stew with vegetables (carrot, potato, celery) accompanied by a fresh green salad.\n\n4. Additional Tips for a Balanced Diet\n- Hydration: It is essential to drink enough water throughout the day to maintain proper hydration.\n- Variety: Avoid eating the same meal every day. Vary your sources of proteins, carbohydrates, and vegetables to obtain all the necessary nutrients.\n- Portion Control: Learn to recognize appropriate portion sizes to avoid consuming more calories than needed.\n- Meal Planning: Organize your weekly meals in advance to maintain a balanced diet and avoid impulsive decisions.\n\n5. Continuous Education\nNutrition is an ever-evolving field. Stay informed through reliable sources and consider consulting a nutritionist to tailor your dietary needs to your lifestyle and personal goals.\n\nFollow these guidelines to improve your eating habits and support your overall well-being. A balanced diet is the foundation of an active and healthy life.",

    "gymTips1": "During your workouts, we recommend resting between 1 and 3 minutes between sets for proper recovery. If using heavy weights, you may extend rest up to 5 minutes.",
    "gymTips2": "Remember this app is designed mainly for weight loss and muscle toning, not specifically for hypertrophy. Therefore, pushing sets to failure is not required unless you prefer it.",
    "gymTips3": "Extreme training intensity isn't necessary for your goals. A balanced routine with consistent effort and rest is more effective.",
    "gymTips4": "We recommend taking at least 2 rest days per week. You can organize them however best suits you, but they are essential for proper recovery.",
    "gymTips5": "After training, it is advisable to consume a source of fast-absorbing protein, such as pure protein shakes mixed with water. With an approximate caloric value of 100 calories, they can be added unofficially to your diet without significant impact.",
    "gymTips6": "If you experience intense muscle soreness, it is crucial to take the necessary rest until you fully recover. Allowing your body the time to repair and rebuild damaged muscle tissue is key for healthy growth and to avoid training under adverse conditions.",
    "gymTips7": "Remember that proper technique is crucial when lifting weights. Focus on controlling the negative phase of each repetition by lowering the weight slowly and steadily. This maximizes muscle activation, reduces the risk of injury, and helps you progress safely and effectively.",
    "infoRutinas": "You have 2 types of routines available,\nfor training at the gym or at home",
    "noGymTips1": "During your home workouts, we recommend taking rest periods of 1 to 2 minutes between sets, as resources may be limited and intensity levels can vary.",
    "noGymTips2": "Remember that home training focuses on functional routines and calisthenics, emphasizing weight loss and muscle toning rather than hypertrophy; adjust your sets according to your level.",
    "noGymTips3": "It is not necessary to replicate the intensities found in a gym; take advantage of your body weight or available home equipment to work out in a balanced and safe manner.",
    "noGymTips4": "Even though home workouts are more accessible, it is recommended to have at least 2 rest days per week to allow your muscles to recover properly.",
    "noGymTips5": "After your home workout, consider consuming a fast-absorbing protein source, such as a simple protein shake, to promote recovery without a high caloric intake.",
    "noGymTips6": "If you experience intense discomfort or pain, it is essential to rest and adjust your home workout intensity to prevent injuries and ensure optimal recovery.",
    "noGymTips7": "Maintain a constant and intense pace during your home workouts. Try to keep breaks as brief as possible without compromising proper technique, maximizing calorie burn and workout efficiency.",
    "noGymTips8": "Plan and structure your routines to optimize results. Pay close attention to the correct execution of each movement, maintain controlled breathing, and use resources that help you stay motivated.",
